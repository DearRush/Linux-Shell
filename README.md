This project writes a linux system shell-like program in C language. And the main file is `myshell.c`。In addtion,these codes use the relevant libraries and functions of C regarding linux system calls.

The program should be run in linux, and the running instructions are not different from the linux shell, the specific manual can be found in the readme file in the folder.

Under the code folder, there is a README file that briefly describes how to use the program, and a pdf file（`Document.pdf`） that briefly describes the background and basics of the program. myshell.c is the main file of the program, and the `env and test` folder contains some code that is used to test the program and the infrastructure of the program.
